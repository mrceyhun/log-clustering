# log-clustering

In "old-notebooks" one can see some of the first tests of the clusterlogs module. Some extra testing can be found here: https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/kGcKstDb1vHpcN2

In the "workflow" folder one can see my attempts of putting information from jupyter notebooks into continuous workflow.
